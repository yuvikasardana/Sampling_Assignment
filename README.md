# Sampling Assignment

This repository contains the solution to an assignment focused on sampling techniques. The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate various sampling methods applied to a credit card dataset and to calculate the accuracy of the sampling methods with different models.

## Files

```Creditcard_data.csv```: The dataset used in the assignment, containing credit card transaction details.

```Sampling_Methods.ipynb```: A Jupyter notebook which first handles the imbalanced class using oversampling/undersampling and then  implements the following sampling methods:
1. Simple Random Sampling
2. Stratified Sampling
3. Systematic Sampling
4. Cluster Sampling
5. Bootstrap Sampling

With the each of the following models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier 
4. Naive Bayes Classifier
5. SVM 

## Results 



## Usage
Open the **Sampling_Methods.ipynb** notebook in Jupyter to view and run the code.
